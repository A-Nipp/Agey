# Agey

### Project description
*Agey* is an age prediction app built using SwiftUI. The user enters any name, and *Agey* then uses the Agify API to fetch a prediction for their age.

</div>

Users can search up any number of names. If they press the "Save Data" button, the app saves the name/age data for that name. The users can then navigate to a bar chart comparing the ages of all the names they've saved. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Users can also specify the settings for their queries. They can select a country (for more specific age prediction) and indicate whether they want to show the count of how many names exist in the database for that country.
